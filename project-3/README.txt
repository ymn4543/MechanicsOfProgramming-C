Hello, some points on the project:

- Most of the try test work, but the ones that do not work I haven't been able 
  to figure out and have been very time consuming. For example, in test 20, I
  execute the same test myself in another shell and the output is correct, yet
  for some reason it doesn't work in the try test.

- The program matches all output given in the writeup. The Queue is an ADT
  that isn't bound to just one type. The family tree is an N-ary tree that
  has no limit on the number of children a person may have.

- All the functions work correctly and output the correct result. 

- All documentation has been included and standard c-style has been followed.

- A lot of effort has been put into this and constant changes have been made due
  to the writeup constantly having stuff added to it. I ask that the grading is
  fair and takes that into consideration. I believe my project is deserving of 
  a good grade. I appreciate the time and effort it takes to create these 
  assignements and grade them. Thank you.
