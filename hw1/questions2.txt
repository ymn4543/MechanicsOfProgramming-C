8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -c main.c
	gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -c circle.c	
        
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        
	gcc -o broken main.o circle.o -lm


    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	In the compute function of main.c, there is an undefined reference
	to the getArea function.
	I found a typo in the file circle.h, where the function was named
	getAreas, instead of getArea. Fixing the function name allowed
	the program to link and be executed correctly.
