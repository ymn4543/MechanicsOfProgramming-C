1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	/home/stu9/s7/ymn4543


2. What command will list the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories without descending into any directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	tree


3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	cd Courses


4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -o warning warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems, but there are issues.
    
    a.) What compiler flags are used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

    	-Wall , -Wextra


    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c
	with the recommended compilation options.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	:  4 points

	warning.c:16:9: states that the variable 'b' in the function compute is never actually used for anything.
	warning.c:23:5: states that the main function can't take only 1 argument, either 0 or 2.
	warning.c:24:9: states that you cannot have an integer array of size 0.
	warning.c:24:21: states that there are too many elements in the array. Since it is size 0, and there is 1 element.
	warning.c:23:15: states that the parameter for the main function 'argc' is never actually used for anything
	warning.c:17:1: states that the function compute should return an integer, since it is not a void function.
    



    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly to
	produce the output specified in the code documentation.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

    d.) There is a 'super-picky' warning flag; what is it and what problem
	does it catch in warning.c?

	:  1 points
		
	-pedantic is the super picky warning flag that  doesn't allow
	an array to be size 0.	

6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
   
		-std=c99



7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile
    
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	C, D, B, A
	
	(Preproccesing, Compilation, Assembling, Linking)
