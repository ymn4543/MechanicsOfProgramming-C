[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[] crash?
	[] infinite loop when it should not?
	[] only work in printed mode?
	[x] work fine?
	[] only implement these options: [list them below]
	[] other? Explain below.


How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.
	
	My move algorithm finds the first available vacant spot in the array, and
	moves the respective agent to that location. The spot left vacant by the moved 
	agent cannot be occupied during that cycle by another moving agent.



============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?

	Most times, the simulation requires less moves each round until it begins
	alternating between a few possibilites. A completly satisfied neighborhood
	of agents is not always found. 



============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

	- How to shuffle a 2d array.
	- How to pass char arrays as params.
	- How to format printing floats
	- How to use and handle command line arguments and their exceptions
	- A lot about how C works, including syntax, type casting

What was easy about this assignment?
	
	- Finding average happiness in neighborhood
	- Choosing infinite/print mode, displaying correct output


What gave you problems or troubles?

	- Populating and shuffling the array
	- The move function
	- Happiness measure function, getting # of neighbors while staying in bound
	- Command line arguments, accessing them and handling error output

What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	I think the insturctions were very clear. One thing I would add is whether 
	the program should continue to run if user puts -h as a command line arg.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	I would have liked to compare different move functions and figure out if
	any of them are more efficient in finding the optimal layout of the grid.
